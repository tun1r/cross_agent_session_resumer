//! Provider trait and concrete provider implementations.
//!
//! Each supported provider (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI,
//! Cursor, Cline, Aider, Amp, OpenCode, ChatGPT, ClawdBot, Vibe, Factory,
//! OpenClaw, Pi-Agent, Kiro, Grok Build) implements the [`Provider`] trait to
//! read/write sessions in its native format.
